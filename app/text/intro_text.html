<h4 style="font-variant: small-caps;">Description</h4>
<p>An online tool capable of estimating the maximum daily number of COVID-19 cases your healthcare system could sustain based on age-based case distribution and severity and the number of appropriable acute and critical care resources.</p>

<h4 style="font-variant: small-caps;">How to use this tool:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>First, review the default age-based case distribution and severity which is based on US data from the <em>CDC.</em></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Optional: You may enter your own custom table based on local clinical data and experience.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Second, tune the <strong>Expected Length of Stay</strong> and <strong>Resource Availability for COVID-19 Cases</strong> parameters to your own environment.</li>
  <li>Third, inspect the bar graph which presents the maximum daily number of COVID-19 cases your healthcare system could sustain based on acute care beds, critical care beds, and mechanical ventilators.</li>
  <li>Fourth, visualize how the results will change when modifying input parameters.</li>
  <li>Fifth, generate a report to keep a copy of the results!</li>
</ol>
