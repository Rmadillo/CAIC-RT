<h5 style="font-variant: small-caps;">Description:</h5>
<p>An online tool capable of estimating the maximum daily number of incident COVID-19 cases that a healthcare system could manage based on age-based case distribution and severity, and the number of appropriable acute and critical care resources.</p>
<hr />
<h5 style="font-variant: small-caps;">How to use this tool:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Review the default age-based case distribution and severity, which is based on US data from the CDC.</li>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Optional: You may enter your own information into the table based on local clinical data and experience.</em></li>
  </ul>
  <li>Tune the inputs for <strong>Expected Length of Stay for COVID-19 Cases</strong> and <strong>Resource Availability for COVID-19 Cases</strong> to your own healthcare environment.</li>
  <li>Inspect the results in the bar graph, which presents the maximum daily number of incident COVID-19 cases that a healthcare system could sustain based on acute care beds, critical care beds, and mechanical ventilators.</li>
  <li>Visualize how the results change when modifying the input parameters.</li>
