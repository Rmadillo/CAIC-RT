<h5 style="font-variant: small-caps;">Description:</h5>
<p>An online tool capable of estimating the maximum daily number of COVID-19 cases your healthcare system could sustain based on age-based case distribution and severity and the number of appropriable acute and critical care resources.</p>
<hr />
<h5 style="font-variant: small-caps;">How to use this tool:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>First, review the default age-based case distribution and severity, which is based on US data from the CDC.</li>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Optional: You may enter your own custom information into the table based on local clinical data and experience.</em></li>
  </ul>
  <li>Second, tune the inputs for <strong>Expected Length of Stay for COVID-19 Cases</strong> and <strong>Resource Availability for COVID-19 Cases</strong> to your own environment.</li>
  <li>Third, inspect the results in the bar graph, which presents the maximum daily number of COVID-19 cases your healthcare system could sustain based on acute care beds, critical care beds, and mechanical ventilators.</li>
  <li>Fourth, visualize how the results change when modifying the input parameters.</li>
  <li>Fifth, generate a report to keep a copy of the results!</li>
